The best way to reset the printer to its factory settings is to perform a full reset. There are 2 possibilities to do this.

Note that the Factory Reset function in the screen menu settings only performs a partial reset.


## Reset from SSH connection
<hr>

!!! Note
    This can also be done from `[Tools] Menu` in <a href="../../helper-script/helper-script-installation">Installation Helper Script</a>.

- Connect to SSH (Guide is available <a href="../../firmwares/ssh-connection">here</a>).

- Enter the following command to perform a full factory reset:

    ``` title="SSH Command Prompt"
    echo "all" | nc -U /var/run/wipe.sock
    ``` 

- Once executed, the `ok` message appears and your printer restarts with the settings reset to default.

- It's necessary to reconnect your printer to your network from screen settings in `Settings` :fontawesome-solid-arrow-right-long: `Network` tab.
