This allows to install Adaptive Bed Meshing (fork of KAMP) modified to works with Ender-3 V3 Series.

Adaptive bed meshing is a way to speed up the bed mesh generation by only probing the area of the bed used by the objects being printed.<br />
When used, the method will automatically adjust the mesh parameters based on the area occupied by the defined print objects. 

!!! Note
    **This procedure must be repeated after restoring the printer to factory settings.**

## Installation
<hr>

- Make sure you have followed this <a href="../../helper-script/helper-script-installation">Install Helper Script</a> section before.

- In the script, enter in `[Install] Menu` by typing ++"1"++ , validate with ++"Enter"++ and install `Adaptive Bed Meshing Support`:

## Configuration
<hr>

All settings for Adaptive Bed Meshing are configured by Helper Script, you just need to make sure that `Exclude Objects` setting is enabled in your slicer.

  - **OrcaSlicer**: In `Others` tab, check `Exclude objets` setting
  - **Creality Print**: Under `Parameter Config`, check `Exclude Objects` setting in `Experimental` tab
  - **PrusaSlicer**: Make sure G-code flavor is set to `Klipper` in `Printer Settings > General > Firmware > G-code flavor` and change the `Label Objects` setting to `Firmware-specific` in `Print Settings > Output options > Output file > Label objects`

## Use
<hr>

To configure the bed mesh type, use the macro `BED_MESH_SETTINGS`:

When `ADAPTIVE BED MESH` is selected, a bed mesh named `adaptive` is done to use adaptative bed mesh when starting a print.

When `FULL BED MESH` is selected, a bed mesh named `default` is done to use adaptative bed mesh when starting a print.

When `NONE` is selected, no bed mesh is performed when starting a print (make sure you have already saved a mesh before).
