## How M600 works
<hr>

Unlike a classic pause which just parks the hotend on the right side and does not stop hotend heater and part fan, `M600` command works as follows:

  - When an M600 is detected in Gcode or if filament runout sensor is triggered, the hotend is parked at the front right of the build plate
  - Filament is ejected from the hotend and fans are stopped
  - At this stage user action is required. If no action is done, the heating of the hotend is stopped after 15 min to avoid thermal runaway
  - User must remove old filament and replace the new one by placing it at the extruder inlet and press the `Resume` button
  - The hotend returns to its original temperature and the fans reactivate to their original state
  - The filament is reinserted into the hotend and a purge is performed before printing resumes
    
    !!! Note
        **Remember to remove excess purge from the hotend before resuming printing.**
