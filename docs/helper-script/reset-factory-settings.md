The best way to reset the printer to its factory settings is to perform a full reset.

Note that the Factory Reset function in the screen menu settings only performs a partial reset.


## Reset
<hr>

- Make sure you have followed this <a href="../../helper-script/helper-script-installation">Install Helper Script</a> section before.

- In the script, enter in `[Tools] Menu` by typing ++"5"++ , validate with ++"Enter"++ and select `Reset factory settings`:

- Once executed, your printer will start with settings reset to default, only user preferences and connection settings are preserved.

    !!! Warning
        **After a factory reset, all features already been installed with <a href="../../helper-script/helper-script-installation">Helper Script for Creality</a>  must be reinstalled.**
