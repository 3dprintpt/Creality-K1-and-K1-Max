The best way to reset the printer to its factory settings is to perform a full reset.

Note that the Factory Reset function in the screen menu settings only performs a partial reset.


## Reset
<hr>

- Make sure you have followed this <a href="../../helper-script/helper-script-installation">Helper Script Installation</a> section before.

- In the script, enter in `[Tools] Menu` by typing ++"5"++ , validate with ++"Enter"++ and select `Reset factory settings`:

- Once executed, the `ok` message appears and your printer restarts with the settings reset to default.

- It's necessary to reconnect your printer to your network from screen settings in `Settings` :fontawesome-solid-arrow-right-long: `Network` tab.

    !!! Warning
        **After a factory reset, all features already been installed with <a href="../../helper-script/helper-script-installation">Helper Script for Creality</a>  must be reinstalled.**
