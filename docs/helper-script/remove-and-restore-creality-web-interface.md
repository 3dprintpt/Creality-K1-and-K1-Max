- The script detects whether Fluidd or Mainsail is installed and will override Creality's default interface.<br />
  If both Fluidd and Mainsail are installed, the script will ask you which Web interface you want to replace Creality's default interface.

- You will then be able to connect to:

    - Fluidd using the following URL: `http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx` by replacing **xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx** by your local IP address (`http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:4408/` also remaining accessible) if you chose **Fluidd** as your default Web interface

    or

    - Mainsail using the following URL: `http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx` by replacing **xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx** by your local IP address (`http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:4409/` also remaining accessible) if you chose **Mainsail** as your default Web interface
