- You can perform a Stress Test with `WARMUP` macro to move the hotend at a defined acceleration with the aim of "warming up" the bearings and rods in order to achieve better movements of the axes and increase the maximum acceleration values. You can define some parameters like numbers of loops, maximum acceleration of X and Y axis:
