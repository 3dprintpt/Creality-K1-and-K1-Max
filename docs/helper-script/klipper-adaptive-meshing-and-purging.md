Two buttons are available on Web interface to control KAMP:

     When KAMP is enabled, a bed mesh named "kamp" is created and loaded to use adaptative bed mesh.<br />
     When KAMP is disabled, a bed mesh named "default" is created and loaded to use classic calibration (full bed mesh).
  - `BED_LEVELING` button to enable/disable classic calibration (full bed mesh) when KAMP is disabled (it have no effect when KAMP is enabled).
