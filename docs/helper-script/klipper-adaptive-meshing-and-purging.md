This allows to install Klipper Adaptive Meshing & Purging modified build to works with K1 Series and Ender-3 V3 Series.

Klipper Adaptive Meshing & Purging is an extension that allows you to generate a mesh and purge line only in the area of the bed used by the objects being printed.<br />
When used, the method will automatically adjust the mesh parameters based on the area occupied by the defined print objects.

More info about KAMP here: :material-github: [GitHub](https://github.com/kyleisah/Klipper-Adaptive-Meshing-Purging)

!!! Note
    **This procedure must be repeated after restoring the printer to factory settings.**

## Configuration
<hr>

All settings for KAMP are configured by Helper Script, you just need to make sure that `Exclude Objects` setting is enabled in your slicer.

  - **OrcaSlicer**: In `Others` tab, check `Exclude objets` setting
  - **Creality Print**: Under `Parameter Config`, check `Exclude Objects` setting in `Experimental` tab
  - **PrusaSlicer**: Make sure G-code flavor is set to `Klipper` in `Printer Settings > General > Firmware > G-code flavor` and change the `Label Objects` setting to `Firmware-specific` in `Print Settings > Output options > Output file > Label objects`

## Use
<hr>

- To configure the bed mesh type, use the `BED_MESH_SETTINGS` macro:

    <img width="600" src="../../assets/img/KAMP/Bed_Mesh_Settings.png">

    - When `ADAPTIVE BED MESH` is selected, a bed mesh named `adaptive` is done to use adaptative bed mesh when starting a print.

    - When `FULL BED MESH` is selected, a bed mesh named `default` is done to use adaptative bed mesh when starting a print.

    - When `NONE` is selected, no bed mesh is performed when starting a print (make sure you have already saved a mesh before).

- To configure the purge line type, use the `PURGE_LINE_SETTINGS` macro:

    <img width="600" src="../../assets/img/KAMP/Purge_Line_Settings.png">

    - When `ADAPTIVE PUGE LINE` is selected, a adaptive purge line near the print area is done when starting a print.

    - When `CLASSIC PURGE LINE` is selected, a classic purge line is done when starting a print.

!!! Note
    Adaptative Bed Mesh and Adaptive Purge Line are loaded by default every time Klipper starts.
