From Fluidd or Mainsail it's possible to classify your Gcode in folders but by default it's not possible to start a print from a folder.

This returns **_code:"key514", "msg":"Malformed command args..._** error. This fix allows that.

!!! Note
    **This procedure must be repeated after restoring the printer to factory settings or if you update the firmware.**


## How to fix that

- Make sure you have followed this <a href="../../helper-script/helper-script-installation">Install Helper Script</a> section before.

- In the script, enter in `[Tools] Menu` by typing ++"5"++ , validate with ++"Enter"++ and select `Fix printing Gode files from folder`:

- Once fix installed, you can now print Gcode files from a folder.
