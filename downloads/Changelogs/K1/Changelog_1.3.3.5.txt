V1.3.3.5 Firmware Update

New Features:
  1. Reworked laser lidar flow calibration feature (K1Max only), compatible with CrealityPrint, Prusa, and Orca slicers, supporting calibration for harder materials such as PLA/PETG/ABS.
  2. Support for speed gear adjustment, with speed modes including Silent/Stable (50%)/Standard (100%)/High Speed (125%).
  3. Added Expert Mode settings, allowing adjustments to flow and Z-axis offset during printing, and support for nozzle PID calibration.
  4. Added ability to skip models.

Firmware Improvements:
  1. Optimized filament runout detection logic.
  2. Updated chassis fan logic; it no longer turns on by default when starting a print, but is now controlled by the chamber temperature (default 35Â°C).
  3. Added Korean language to the firmware.
  4. Added filament runout status display to the home page.

Bug Fixes:
  1. Fixed an issue where the UI would frequently crash and cause a black screen reboot during model skip printing.
  2. Fixed an inconsistency between the maximum bed temperature on the web interface and on the screen.
  3. Fixed an issue where the app would not display the monitoring video when synchronization between systems was unsuccessful.
  4. Fixed a problem where the printing task would not exit if the print file name was abnormal.
