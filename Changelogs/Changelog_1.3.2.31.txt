Known Issues:
1. Updating the firmware from V1.3.0.x will disconnect the printer from Creality Cloud. To reconnect, please bind them again.
2. The system may freeze if you try to upload a file when the 8G storage space is already filled up. In this case, you need to flash the firmware via a USB cable. To avoid this risk, please delete useless G-code files regularly.
