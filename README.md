# Wiki for Creality Helper Script

## About

This guide explains the whole process to root Creality **K1 Series** and **Ender-3 V3 Series** and add features to your printer using Creality Helper Script.

The advantage is having full access to the firmware and configuration files to be able to make changes.

If you don't know what you're doing, I don't recommend following this guide.
